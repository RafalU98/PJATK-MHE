Welcome,
To start the Program enter following:

1ST ARGUMENT = Function (b -> BruteForce, r -> Random-Solution, hd -> Hill Climb Deterministic, hr -> Hill Climb Randomized, tabu -> Tabu method
Or if you want all functions: all -> all algorithms

2ND ARGUMENT = Iterations as an Integer
3RD ARGUMENT = nonogram.json (Edit with your own Nonogram). You can also choose a sample: nonogram*.json, where * is a number from 1 to 3
4TH ARGUMENT = list of tabu size

5TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want too see the time, that the function needed. 0 if not
6TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want too see the convergence curve of the function. 0 if not
7TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want too see the solution of the function. 0 if not
8TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want too see the quality or mistakes of the result. 0 if not
9TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want too see the total iterations of the function. 0 if not
10TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want too see how many times the quality got better. 0 if not
