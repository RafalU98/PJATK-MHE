Metaheuristics at PJATK-GdaÅ„sk - Solving Nonogram with using diffrent algorithms

## Nonogram
Nonogram also known as Paint by numbers is a logical puzzle which consist of a grid in which cell are either colored or left blank according to the numbers at the side, the solution of such a puzzle reveals a pixel-art picture. The numbers of this puzzle are displayed in a form of discrete tomography which measures how many consistent lines are filled/colored squeres that are in a given row or column.

### TUTORIAL
        To start the Program enter following:

        1ST ARGUMENT = Function (b -> BruteForce, r -> Random-Solution, hd -> Hill Climb Deterministic, hr -> Hill Climb Randomized,
        tabu -> Tabu method Or if you want all functions: all -> all algorithms

        2ND ARGUMENT = Iterations as an Integer
        3RD ARGUMENT = nonogram.json (Edit with your own Nonogram). 
        You can also choose a sample: nonogram*.json, where * is a number from 1 to 3
        
        4TH ARGUMENT = list of tabu size

        5TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want to see the time, that the function needed. 0 if not
        6TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want to see the convergence curve of the function. 0 if not
        7TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want to see the solution of the function. 0 if not
        8TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want to see the quality or mistakes of the result. 0 if not
        9TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want to see the total iterations of the function. 0 if not
        10TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want to see how many times the quality got better. 0 if not
        11TH ARGUMENT = 1 if you want to see the solution nonogram. . 0 if not
