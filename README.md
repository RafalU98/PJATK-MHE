Metaheuristics at PJATK-Gda≈Ñsk - Solving Nanogram with using diffrent algorithms

## Nanogram
Nanogram also known as Paint by numbers is a logical puzzle which consist of a grid in which cell are either colored or left blank according to the numbers at the side, the solution of such a puzzle reveals a pixel-art picture. The numbers of this puzzle are displayed in a form of discrete tomography which measures how many consistent lines are filled/colored squeres that are in a given row or column.

### ZADANIE 1
        Implement the data structures for the task.
 
        You need a task structure to be solved. In the case of a traveling salesman, 
        it will be a set of cities with distances between cities (or a measure of distance function).
 
        You need a solution structure. In the case of a traveling salesman, 
        this will be a list that sets the order of the cities to visit.
